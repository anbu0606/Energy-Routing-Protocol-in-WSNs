## üìò Overview

This project presents an **Efficient Energy, Least Cost, Quality of Service-Based Routing Protocol (ECQSR)** for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), designed to optimize energy consumption and extend network lifetime using intelligent optimization algorithms.

Implemented entirely in **MATLAB**, this project compares three optimization strategies:

- **Nearest Neighbor (NN) Algorithm**
- **Tabu Search (TS)**
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**

Each algorithm was evaluated on path efficiency, energy consumption, and computational time. The proposed protocol helps in selecting energy-efficient, low-cost paths for data routing in WSNs, while meeting QoS requirements.

## üìå Objectives

- To develop an energy-aware and QoS-supported routing protocol.
- To optimize routing paths using intelligent algorithms.
- To compare NN, TS, and ACO in terms of efficiency, cost, and performance.
- To improve the lifetime and reliability of WSNs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Used

### 1. **Nearest Neighbor (NN)**  
- Greedy heuristic for path selection.
- Selects the nearest unvisited node at each step.
- Fastest in execution, ideal for networks with ‚â§300 nodes.

### 2. **Tabu Search (TS)**  
- Memory-based local search.
- Prevents cycling with a "tabu list".
- Slower but finds better global minima.

### 3. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**  
- Inspired by ant foraging behavior.
- Probabilistic decision-making based on pheromone trails.
- Performs well with large search spaces.

## üìä Results & Performance Evaluation

| Algorithm | Language | Cost     | Execution Time |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| NN        | MATLAB   | 374.03   | 0.68 sec       |
| TS        | MATLAB   | 405.90   | 41.54 sec      |
| ACO       | MATLAB   | 489.90   | 7.49 sec       |

- **NN** performed best in small-to-mid-size networks due to faster convergence and lower cost.
- **TS** yielded competitive results but was more computationally intensive.
- **ACO** showed higher path cost in this experiment, though it is scalable to larger datasets.
